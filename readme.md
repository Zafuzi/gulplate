# Gulplate

Gulplate is a simple template that I created to make my life a little simpler. It uses pug(formerly Jade) for templating and gulp for processing.

## Features to add
- [ ] Move to SASS from LESS
- [ ] Make the gulpfile compile external libraries into a compact file for production ready use
